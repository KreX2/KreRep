                    We choose the word Klassik since it instills a simple yet meaningful energy unto
                    those who see or glance at it. A play off of the word classic making it seem to 
                    have a playful and somewhat ambitous demeanor. In order to make it clear that 
                    the foods we list on the website are go to foods.

                    It's filled with 10 of the most "classic" and recognizable foods in our humble
                    region of Negros Island. Although unevenly split between the two regions of the 
                    island; Negros Oriental and Negros Occidental. It is still allows any viewer to 
                    somewhat experience the massive culture of the island through the food.

                    They are, to the best of our knowledge, the most accurate rendition of the original. 
                    This is mostly due to the fact that most meals are sold by restaurants and businesses. 
                    rather than being a popular recipe in the region (though several are included on the list), 
                    Their exact recipes are kept concealed since they are critical components of the company. 
                    Revealing such "secret recipes" will have a significant impact on their enterprises, thus 
                    these recipes are what would be the closest you can get.

                    Negros Island as our foundation just made so much sense to us since it's already
                    a well known as wonderful place to retire for locals and foreigners alike.
                    With the attention of the world on Negros already releasing something like this 
                    would only attract more attention 
                    to the island perhaps in hopes of creating the food or just
                    simply trying it out, Negros was a perfect place to start something like this.

                    The foods we chose one of if not the most recognazible and known foods in 
                    Negros Island. Not the easiest to make but the most satisfying to complete.
                    A delicious challenge to those who decide to make them and a yummy experience 
                    to those who will simply purchase them.

                    The majority of the items on the list are desserts due to many Negros Island residents having sweet tooths. 
                    The non-sweet recipes on the list although less in number but no shortage in flavor. We decided ,instead of 
                    separating them, combine the sweet and savory in order to create a more diverse list.
